* What is Riak Control?
Riak Control is a set of webmachine resources, all accessible via
the /admin/* paths, allow you to inspect your running cluster,
and manipulate it in various ways.

* Note on Supported Browsers
Riak Control does not currently support Internet Explorer.

* How Do I Start Riak Control?
By default, Riak Control is disabled. There are a few, simple steps
to get it up and running.

** Modify the Node's app.config File.
Riak Control is completely managed through the app.config file for
Riak. Riak Control requires SSL for authentication purposes and
therefore you will need to enable HTTPS, SSL, and riak_control.

*** Enable HTTPS and SSL in riak_core:
In the riak_core section of app.config, there should sections
for HTTPS and SSL commented out. You will need to uncomment them
back in.

WARNING: In order for your node to be accessible via HTTP and the
riak_control admin panel to be available via HTTPS, you will need
to change the HTTPS port to something else:

: {https, [ {"127.0.0.1", 8069} ]}

You will also need to generate your own self-signed certificate
(http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html) or modify the
app.config to point to your own:

: {ssl, [ {certfile, "./etc/cert.pem"},
:         {keyfile, "./etc/key.pem"}
:       ]}

**** SSL with Intermediate Authorities
If you are using a certificate that includes an intermediate authority, include the `cacertfile` key and value:

: {ssl, [
:        {certfile, "./etc/cert.pem"},
:        {cacertfile, "./etc/cacert.pem"},
:        {keyfile, "./etc/key.pem"}
:       ]},

*** Enable riak_control and setup basic authentication
In the riak_control section of app.config, first you'll need to
make sure that it is enabled:

: {enabled, true}

Next, you'll need to specify the style of authentication you would
like performed when accessing the admin panel. Currently the only
valid authentication styles are 'userlist' and 'none'.

: {auth, userlist}

If you choose 'userlist' as your authentication method, you need to
also create one. You specify a list of usernames and passwords (as
plaintext) that your administrators will use to connect to the admin
panel.

: {userlist, [{"username", "password"}, ...]}

Finally, the Riak Control admin panel is broken up into several
sections, each can be toggled on and off. Currently, the only section
is the 'admin' section. You need to ensure that it is enabled.

: {admin, true}

** Start or Restart Riak
Once the above changes have been made, you can now start or restart
your Riak node. You will then be able to access the admin panel by
pointing your browser to it:

: https://127.0.0.1:8069/admin

In the above URL, it was assumed that 8069 was used as the SSL port
in your app.config file.

* What Information Does Riak Control Provide?
The Riak Control admin panel is broken up into several sections.

** Snapshot
This is a quick "health check" for your cluster. If Riak Control finds
anything worrisome, it will let you know and provide links to pages
where you can diagnose and/or fix the problem.

If a node is running Riak pre-1.1, it will be listed as incompatible
in the Riak Control interface.  While in this state, Riak Control will
be unable to retrieve and display statistics and configuration for that
node.

** Cluster
This is a high-level overview of your cluster. It lists each of the
nodes in the cluster and their current status, partition ownerships,
and memory usage. If a node is currently offline it will be red.

If you click on a node, the details to the right should provide you
with some additional actions you can perform on the node (e.g. shutdown,
leave the cluster, mark as 'down' if offline).

Additionally, at the top of the list of nodes is a field that you
can use to either add another, single node to this node's cluster or to
join this node to an existing cluster. Just type in the name of the
node you wish to add/join and click "Add".

** Ring
This Ring Overview gives you a quick glimpse into all the partitions
in your ring, what nodes own them, whether they are offline, handing
off data, and what services are currently running on them (e.g. kv,
pipe, search).

You can quickly filter the partitions and see only those you are
interested in.

There will be many more features and enhancements to this section
in the immediate future...

** Stats
Coming soon...

This section will allow you to inspect the riak-admin status attributes
for any node in your cluster.

** Objects
Coming soon...

This section will allow you to add simple objects to your cluster and
fetch/update existing nodes.

** Map/Reduce
Coming soon...

This section will allow you to build and execute custom map/reduce
queries as well as save them for use later.

** Graphs
Coming soon...

This section will display live graphs that will help you to diagnose
problems you may be having with your node(s) and/or cluster. It will
also be pretty to just sit back and watch. ;-)

** Console
Coming soon...

This section will allow you to see live updates of any of your
nodes' log files.

** Support
Coming soon...

This section will easily let you file a bug/ticket with Basho. It
will also bundle up any graphs, stats, and other data that will
assist Basho in diagnosing and fixing the problem.
